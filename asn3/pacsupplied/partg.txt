Note that there is a strange field called this$0.
Can you explain why? Can you explain why some records have two fields with this name?

Answer:

The this$0 field is a reference in the inner class to the outer class which where it is inside.
The inner class has a hidden reference to its enclosing class.

The case where there are 2 this$0 fields is seen in the the inner class of B.
This is because the B class and its inner class extends the A class and its inner class.
Therefore the inner class must have a reference to its enclosing class and the super class of its enclosing class.
